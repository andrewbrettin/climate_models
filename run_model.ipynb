      "    The values in the result follow so-called \"standard\" order: If ``A =\n",
      "    fft(a, n)``, then ``A[0]`` contains the zero-frequency term (the sum of\n",
      "    the signal), which is always purely real for real inputs. Then ``A[1:n/2]``\n",

      "    \n",
      "    Correspondingly, when the spectrum is purely real, the signal is\n",
      "    Hermitian.  The `hfft` family of functions exploits this symmetry by\n",
